Roles
Crucible is a flexible application that caters for a wide range of team sizes and work styles. You will need to know about the basic roles used in Crucible:
authors: Usually the creator of the code; the person who will act on the review's outcome.
reviewer: A participant that will comment on the source files in the review, raising points and discussion on the work that was done.
moderator: Usually the person who starts the review and is responsible for deciding the outcomes and closing it. The moderator is disabled for the "agile" permission scheme to simplify workflow.
